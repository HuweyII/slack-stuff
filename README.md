It's the same for both scripts.  You must provide four variables each surrounded in quotes.<br>
<br>
scriptname "botname" "emoji" "channel" "message"<br>
<br>
#botname = The name of the bot the message should appear as
#emoji = The emoji that will appear as the bot's avatar
** NOTE: This won't work right on mobile in a lot of cases.
#channel = The channel or user that you are sending the message to
#message = Whatever you are sending.
